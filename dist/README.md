# TrueDoubleTap

Risk of Rain 2 mod to make the Commando really double tap.

Reupload due to account issue.

Instead of the commando firing at a consistent rate, he now fires a burst of two shots with a longer pause between bursts.
The burst speed ratio (default 0.3) can be configured between 0.01 (almost instant) and 1 (same as unmodded) in the `/BepInEx/config/com.Timmeh42.TrueDoubleTap.cfg` file.
Values are clamped to that range, or set to 1 if invalid.
Overall his attack speed is unchanged, so this is an 'ethical' mod to use.
Very simple mod that should be compatible with anything.

### Installation
