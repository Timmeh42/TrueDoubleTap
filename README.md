# TrueDoubleTap

Risk of Rain 2 mod to improve the Commando's primary fire

 - Instead of the commando firing at a consistent rate, he now fires a burst of two shots with a longer pause between bursts, with the same average attack speed
 - Now has an option to scale down the bullet spread when firing a lot (0 is a good number)


Configuration is done in the `/BepInEx/config/com.Timmeh42.TrueDoubleTap.cfg` file, which appears after loading the game once.

 - The burst speed ratio (default 0.3) can be configured between 0.01 (almost instant) and 1 (same as unmodded). Overall his attack speed is unchanged, so this is an 'ethical' mod to use.

 - The bullet spread scaling (default 1, same as unmodded) can be anything 0 or higher (maybe you want MUL-T's spread?) 

### Installation

- Requires BepInEx
- Copy the dll to the BepinEx plugins folder
