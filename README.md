# TrueDoubleTap
#### By Timmeh42

Risk of Rain 2 mod to make the Commando really double tap.

Instead of the commando firing at a consistent rate, he now fires a burst of two shots with a longer pause between bursts.
Overall his attack speed is unchanged, so this is an 'ethical' mod to use.
Very simple mod that should be compatible with anything.
